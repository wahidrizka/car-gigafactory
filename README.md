Car Gigafactory is a Java-based simulation project designed to model the production and operation of different types of sedan vehicles, specifically petrol and electric variants. This project uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and adheres to the SOLID principles to create a flexible, scalable, and maintainable codebase.

The Car Gigafactory simulation includes:
- Type F (Petrol-based sedan): Powered by a petrol engine with an internal combustion mechanism.
- Type E (Electric-based sedan): Powered by an electric motor, using a rechargeable battery as the energy source.

With a command-line interface, users can select and interact with different car types to simulate various actions, such as accelerating, braking, and refueling. This simulation helps demonstrate differences between conventional and electric vehicle systems, making it useful for educational purposes or as a foundational project for more complex automotive simulations.

### Features:
- **Vehicle Abstraction**: A generic ``Vehicle`` class provides a base for different car types.
- **Engine and Storage Flexibility**: Modular design allows easy swapping between petrol and electric engines as well as storage systems (fuel tanks and batteries).
- **Interactive CLI**: A command-line interface for users to interact with and test drive different car models.

### Technology Stack:
- Java (Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and S.O.L.I.D. architecture)
- Command-line interface for interaction
- Modular class structure for easy expandability

This project is ideal for those looking to explore Java programming, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, and the architecture behind different types of vehicle power systems.
